# javascript and classes

# Does javascript have classes?
Yes, javascript does have clases . This feature was introduced with ECMAScipt 2015 specification(often referred to to as ES6).However , note that javascipt is primarily a prototype based language , and its classes are paimarily syntactic sugar over existing prototype based inheritence menchanisms. In other words , it provides a more familiar syntax for developers coming from class - based languges such as java , C++ but under the hood , it works somewhat differently.
OOP is just a programing//way paradiem.
